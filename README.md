# TechnicalAssessmentFhirDE
This REPO is dedicated to the CMS dataset coding challenge for Health Partners.

## Instructions
Given the CMS provider data metastore, write a script that downloads all data sets related to the theme "Hospitals". 
Here is the dataset: https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/metastore/schemas/dataset/items

> The column names in the csv headers are currently in mixed case with spaces and special characters. Convert all column names to snake_case (Example: "Patientsâ€™ rating of the facility linear mean score" becomes "patients_rating_of_the_facility_linear_mean_score").  

> The csv files should be downloaded and processed in parallel, and the job should be designed to run every day, but only download files that have been modified since the previous run (need to track runs/metadata).  

_Please email your code and a sample of your output to your recruiter or interviewer.  Add any additional comments or description below._

## Submission Requirements:
- The job must be written in python and must run on a regular Windows or linux computer (i.e. there shouldn't be anything specific to Databricks, AWS, etc.)
- Include a requirements.txt file if your job uses python packages that do not come with the default python install
